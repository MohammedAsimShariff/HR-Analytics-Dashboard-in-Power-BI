# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-in-Power-BI

The HR analytics dashboard in Power BI is designed to offer insights into various aspects of employee attrition within the organization. Through data analysis, several key findings have emerged:

1. Salary: The data suggests that salary may be a significant factor contributing to attrition, particularly for employees earning up to 5K. This indicates a potential need for salary adjustments or incentive programs to improve retention among lower-paid employees.

2. Career Stage: Employees in the early stages of their careers exhibit higher attrition rates. This highlights the importance of implementing strategies to engage and retain younger employees, such as career development opportunities and mentorship programs.

3. Years at Company: Attrition tends to be higher in the earlier stages of an employee's tenure with the company, with a decrease in attrition as years at the company increase. This pattern suggests the need to focus on improving the onboarding experience and fostering a supportive work environment for new hires.

4. Job Roles: Certain job roles, such as Laboratory Technicians, Research Scientists, Sales Executives, and Sales Representatives, experience higher attrition rates compared to others. This indicates potential challenges or dissatisfaction within these specific roles, warranting further investigation and targeted retention efforts.

These insights provide valuable information for HR professionals and management to address attrition issues effectively. By leveraging the power of data analytics through the HR analytics dashboard in Power BI, the organization can make informed decisions to optimize its human resources management practices and ultimately improve employee retention and satisfaction.
